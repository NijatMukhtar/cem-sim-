# Data Folder

This folder stores simulation output data generated by the **firmware layer** (`cem_sim.exe`).

Each run produces a structured log file (`run_log.jsonl`) that records:
- Time steps (`t`)
- Disk and rotor angles (`disk_angle`, `piece_angle`)
- Active electromagnet indices (`active[]`)
- Operating parameters (RPM, overlap, phase offset, mode)

These logs are used by the **visualization layer** (`viz/index.html`) to replay or analyze electromagnetic commutation patterns.

> ⚠️ Note: This folder may be `.gitignored` if large or auto-generated logs are produced.
> Keep only representative runs (e.g., `run_log.jsonl`) for reference and documentation.
